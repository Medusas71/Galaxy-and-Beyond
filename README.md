# Description 

Hi I'm [Megan](https://github.com/Medusas71) and I'm [Manni](https://github.com/manni8436) and we are part of the Nerd Alert Team (logo). We are collaborating together to expand our coding experience.

Our first project, Galaxy and Beyond is a website all about Planets, Galaxies and the History of Space. Space is something we are both curious about. It is fascinating to see all the stars in the sky and know there are other planets in our solar system.

We hope you enjoy our site and learn something new.

# User Experience (UX)

<a id="user-stories"></a>
## User Stories  

First Time Customer Goals

* As a first time customer to the website, I would like to:
  * Look at the different planets and their relevant information on each planet
  * Find out more information regarding Galaxies
  * Look at the history of space
  * Find out some Fascinating Facts regarding Space, Planets and Galaxies
  * Be able to contact the owners of the website
  * Find out more about the people that created the website and why they created the website

## 5 Planes

<a id="strategy"></a>
### 1. Strategy

The purpose of this project is to create a site where users can learn about Planets, Galaxies and the History of Space.

<a id="scope"></a>
### 2. Scope

The features of this project will include:

* The ability to:
  * view planets
  * find out information regarding planets
  * view galaxies
  * find out information regarding galaxies
  * view the history of space
  * find out information regarding the history of space
  * be able to contact the developers of the site
  * find out more about the developers of the site and why they chose space for their website

<a id="structure"></a>
### 3. Structure

The information is grouped logically for all users. The Interaction Design (IXD) will be consistent between pages where the navigation bar is fixed and tailored to have the priority items displayed first at the top of the screen. The footer will also be consistent between pages and the footer is fixed at the bottom of the page. The site will be consistent with what users expect from a space website.

<a id="skeleton"></a>
### 4. Skeleton

The [wireframes](./assets/documents/wireframes/galaxies-and-beyond.pdf) have been created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) and were created for Desktop, Tablet and Phone. 

Here are the individual wireframes:

* [Home Page Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/home-page.png)
* [Planets Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/planets.png)
* [Individual Planets Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/individual-planet.png)
* [Galaxies Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/galaxies.png)
* [Individual Galaxy Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/individual-galaxy.png)
* [History Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/history.png)
* [About Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/about-us.png)
* [Contact Us Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/contact-us.png)
* [404 Error Wireframe](/assets/images/readme-images/wireframes/404-error.png)

<a id="surface"></a>
### 5. Surface 

Colour Scheme

* The colour scheme represents space, by using a background colour of black #000 on all links and white #fff for all text.
* Originally we used the standard blue for the hover colour, but that did not pass accessibility, so it was changed to a blue crayola #1A71F4.
* A nickel colour of #787167 is used around the menu links and throughout each page at the bottom of the header, top of the footer and around each card.
* The header and footer have the same background image - see Imagery.
* The body of each page has the same background image - see Imagery.

![4 Colours](assets/images/readme-images/website-colours.png)
Colours were displayed using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-000000-1a71f4-787167).

* The colours were checked through [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure the final colours were accessible.

![WebAIM Link Contrast Checker](assets/images/readme-images/webaim-link-contrast-checker.jpg)

Typography

* The fonts were sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
* The Trispace font is the main font used throughout the whole website with sans-serif as the fallback font.
* This font was chosen due to it being a 'space' font.

Imagery

* The header and footer background both use a stary-sky image that was sourced from XXX? (insert link here).
* Each page has a space shuttle in the header that slides in when navigating to any page. The space shuttle was sourced from XXX? (Insert link here)
* The body background uses a star image that was sourced from http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2012/160/b/9/stars_by_paulinemoss-d52un4e.jpg by a google search and an animation was added so the stars are constantly moving.
* The 404 error page image was sourced from https://www.behance.net/gallery/123773233/Error-404-landing-page-template?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended%7C404%20oops by searching 404 Error Space in Google.
